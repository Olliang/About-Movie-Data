# Movie Rating and Release Year Analysis

(Dataset used: MovieLens 20M)

### Problem Statement:

The number of movies released was growing exponentially from 1880s to 2010s. However, more ratings are seen on the movies released during the year from 1993 to 1996. While there was an exponentially increasing number of movies released after this period, there are exponentially decreasing number of ratings on the newer movies. Is this a natual peak due to the cumulated ratings covering a longer period? Has the MovieLens Website become less popular after that period? What kinds of movies caused this great popularity? Are those ratings mostly positive?

### Story Line:

#### (1)

Overall, the number of movies released was growing exponentially. There is a staggered spike indicating that more ratings were done on movies released between 1993 and 1996 (targeted years). While there was an exponentially increasing number of movies released after this period, there was an exponentially decreasing number of ratings on the newer movies. Is this a natural peak due to the cumulated ratings covering a longer period? Has the MovieLens Website become less popular after that period? What movies caused this great popularity? Are they more positive ratings?

The rating data generated by users started majorly from 1996, the year when Movie Lens website obtained one of the peaks of the numebr of ratings. The other 2 peaks of the number of ratings happens in the year of 2000 and 2005. However, the ratings on movies released during the year between 1993 and 1996 were only taken up over 50% out of the total ratings of the year in the first two years, which are 1996 and 1997. In other years after 1997, the movies released during the target years only covered  5% to 20% ratings of the year. Therefore, the extraordinarily high ratingcount on the movies released during 1993-1996 is not due to the consistent high popularity over a long period. There is a linear decrease in the ratingcount since 2008, was the website becoming less and less popular?

The first year of the operation, 1996, has the highest number of active users (close to 30K) and is the only peak over around 20 years' website operation. The numbers of users in the rest of years are between 3K to 15K. So it made sense that 1996 was one of the peaks on the ratingcount and was able to cover a large number of movies released in targeted years. However, even though there were relatively much fewer users in the rest of the years, the ratings done by the limited number of users in 2000 and 2005 were higher than in 1996. This might be due to some marketing campaine conducted. A very interesting phenomenon is that over 80% users every year rated the movies released during the targeted year, which indicated that there were not many users who only rate the movies newly released. Fewer users and ratings after 1996 as well as the consistent favor by a significant number of users made the rating count on the newly emerged movies hard to surpress the ones released during the targeted years.

Were there certain genres that extraordinarily popular among the movies released in the targeted year, which eventually caused the high ratingcount? The number of ratings in all genres during the targeted years(1993-1996) are all above the average. In terms of the growth, the number of ratings on War and Western movies released during those years is about 4 to 6 times more than the average. IMAX movie have 3 times more than the average level and has the most number of rating among all genres. However, we know that there are plenty of movies that are labeled as multiple genres, are those increase ratings on several genres caused by the same blockbusters released during the years between 1993 and 1996?

From the Top movies that have the most number of ratings for the targeted Genres released during the targeted years, we see no repeated movies, we can tell that the popularity of the genres is each associated with several popular movies within the genre category.
